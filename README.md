# CVD_prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict risk of developing CVD (cardiovascular disease). 
The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset
In this project, we test performance of 7 different machine learning models. The model chosen for deployment for the app is the logistic_regression_final_model.sav (72 % accuracy, 66% recall). 
Dash app was used to deploy the model. The application can be found at app.py. Simply run the code and click on the link displayed on the terminal.
